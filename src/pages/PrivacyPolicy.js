                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our
                    mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature
                    or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
                    preference not to have data about your online browsing
                    activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                    been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT
                    browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
                    standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
                    in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
                    revised version of this Privacy Policy. Most web browsers
                    and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile
                    applications] include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
                    not to have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. If you set the DNT signal on your
                    browser, we will respond to such DNT browser signals.
